## Read Me FIRST! - Requires NodeJS Version 18 or higher

> Do NOT edit this README. Go to [apps/README.md]() to view and edit user README

## Template Maintenance

1 - Setup to allow incoming merge from upstream template update

```bash
# run once only after you `clone`, or `fork` or `delete .git and run git init`
./setup-upstream.sh
```

2 - Setup for your custom code

```bash
# setup your env file
cp apps/.env.sample apps/.env # secret properties can be in apps/.env.secret
```

**Important notes**
- DO NOT develop custom code in `apps/app-sample`. Rename it or copy it to another folder name
- In apps/apploader.js, change `app-sample` to the folder you are using
- userland changes ONLY in the `apps` folder, NEVER outside the folder. Contact template maintainer if you need something outside `apps`
- do note any conflicts to resolve when merging from upstream

3 - Updating the template

```bash
# Commit and push to remote before running commands below
git fetch upstream # includes tags
git pull upstream <branch or tag> --no-rebase
# NO MORE IN USE git merge upstream/<branch or tag> --allow-unrelated-histories
# There may be some template related merge conflicts to resolve.
```

**Suggested Conventions**
- branch
  - main = stable
  - work = working branch
  - feat-<issue number>
  - bugfix-<issue number>
- release tags
  - use semver, e.g. 1.2.3
  - should tag main branch

  - export const store = reactive({}) used [instead of Vuex](https://pinia.vuejs.org/introduction.html#Why-should-I-use-Pinia)

Unit & Integration Tests:

- To run unit & integration test on **/api/categories** endpoint. E2E testing is **Work In Progress**
- TO TEST EVERYTHING PLEASE change describe.only(...) to describe(...) in the test scripts in **apps/app-sample/tests**

See package.json

```bash
# run in development only
npm run test
```

## Running Using Docker/Podman

For running using docker/podman

```bash
docker build -t express-template --target production --build-arg ARG_NODE_ENV=dev --build-arg ARG_API_PORT=3000 .
docker run -p 3000:3000 express-template

    - container repo tag

Build image and deploy to a container registry
