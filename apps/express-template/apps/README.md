## Configuration (Environment Files)

- .env.<env> : non-sensitive config values
- .env.secret.<env> : values that are secret (should be in `vault` service for production)
- JSON values are supported, be aware of syntax errors when setting up

## Some Features

### SAML, OIDC, OAuth

- SAML & OIDC: requires [Keycloak](docker-devenv/keycloak/README.md) to be setup and express server to be run
- You can test out on [sso.html](http://127.0.0.1:3000/sso.html). The file source is [apps/app-sample/public/demo-express/sso.html]()
- for SAML and OIDC... credentials is `test` / `test`, redirect to the keycloak IDP
- for OAUTH **requires setup of github account and configs**
- Refer to the following file [router/auth.js]()

### Fido2 - TO TEST

Refer to following files for SPA sample (uses fido2-lib in backend)

- [apps/app-sample/public/demo-express/fido.html]()
  - you might need to use nip service for a "pseudo-domain" to test locally
  - take note of and use the private IP on your local machine
- [apps/app-sample/routes/fido.js]()
- you will need Windows Hello or similar service on OSX

### Push Notification

- ensure that you enable permissions for the browser
- sometimes the notifications may be blocked by company policy, you may get a push event, but no notification pops-up
- Refer to following files for SPA sample
  - [apps/app-sample/routes/webpush.js]()
  - [apps/app-sample/public/demo-express/pn.html]()
- Uses Webpush or Google FCM, Webpush is easier (sample config uses Webpush and runs on http://127.0.0.1:3000)
- Click the following buttons in order (see their output in console.log and screen):
  - (1) Subscribe PN, (2) Send And Receive Test PN, (3) Unsubscribe PN
- For Google FCM, setup your firebase account and messaging, also FCM server key in backend

## Relational Database Schema

### Simple Relation

- books <- 1 --- 1 -> categories - one book belongs to one category
- books <- M --- N -> authors - one book has many authors, and an author can have more than 1 book
- books <- 1 --- M -> pages - one book has many pages

### Simple Table Schema

- authors - id, name
  1, author1
  2, author2

- categories - id, name
  1, cat1
  2, cat2

- books - id, name, categoryId
  1, book1, 1
  2, book2, 1

- pages - id, name, bookId
  1, pageA, 1
  2, pageB, 1
  3, pageC, 2
  4, pageD, 2
  5, pageE, 2

- book_author - bookId, authorId
  1, 1
  1, 2
  2, 1
  2, 2
